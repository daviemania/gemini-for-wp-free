Caching is the internet’s short-term memory. <strong>Instead of making the
  server re-cook every single page on every single visit, caching ensures that
  websites keep ready-to-serve copies</strong>—a simple change which, alone, can
transform sluggish WordPress installs into sites that feel alive. By definition,
<strong>caching is the process of storing frequently accessed web data in fast,
  temporary storage</strong> (the cache) ensuring speedy delivery for subsequent
requests. At its crux, #caching is mostly composed of three collaborating
layers: t<strong>he application layer</strong> (page caching + object caching),
<strong>the server layer</strong> (Varnish or Memcached), and <strong>edge
  caching</strong> (effected via a CDN such as Cloudflare).

<strong>As a WordPress site owner, creator, freelance developer, or SMB, dealing
  with server-side caching can be quite taxing, especially when you lack the
  tools to effectively tweak your stack for maximum performance</strong>. Even
so, server-side caching can be one of the most impactful stack points. One that
you can leverage in ensuring huge leaps in site performance, better user
experience, and meeting the needs of your readers (or customers). In this
article, <strong>we’ll look into the various ways of turbo-boosting server-side
  caching on your WordPress/WooCommerce site</strong>. We’ll explain what
configs/approaches have worked for us, and introduce you to a powerful
server-caching combination—that will ensure that you can marry all 3 layers of
#WordPressCaching for the ultimate performance of your site/business. Beyond
that, <strong>we’ll share how, after trying dozens of hosts and stacks, we
  landed on Cloudways as the ultimate cloud hosting platform</strong>, and how
it stitches the three caching layers into a single manageable, pre-tuned
platform.

<h2>2) The 3 WordPress Caching Layers</h2>
As shared earlier, <strong>WordPress caching is composed of three layers: the
  application layer, server layer, and the edge cache layer</strong>. Whenever a
user requests a page from your WP website, their request is routed through these
layers as follows:

<strong><em>Browser -&gt; Edge (Cloudflare) -&gt; Server (Varnish -&gt;
    Nginx/Apache -&gt; PHP-FPM) -&gt; Redis/Object Caching / DB</em></strong>
<h3>1. The Application Layer</h3>
<strong>The application layer of WordPress caching is responsible for caching
  rendered pages at the WordPress level, as well as caching database
  queries</strong> (or PHP objects) using object caching. This is done via a
cache plugin, which interfaces with object caching if available, to ensure that
cached versions of your site's pages are delivered—on subsequent requests.
Essentially, if and when the same resources are requested again. On Cloudways,
our web-host of choice, caching happens at the WordPress level via their
powerful <strong>Breeze cache plugin</strong>. The plugin is responsible for
identifying frequent requests (such as home page fetches), producing a cache of
that page, and then ensuring it is delivered on subsequent requests—without
necessarily hitting the database each time. [caption id="attachment_4579"
align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img
  class="size-large wp-image-4579"
  src="https://maniainc.com/technology/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/A-screenshot-of-the-Breeze-Wordpress-plugin-by-Cloudways-Mania-Developers-1024x572.png"
  alt="A screenshot of the Breeze Wordpress plugin by Cloudways - Mania Developers | maniainc.com/mania-developers"
  width="1024"
  height="572"
/> A screenshot of the Breeze Wordpress plugin by Cloudways.[/caption] Think of
it this way, user A visits a page, loves it so much that they share it with
their friends: users B and C. These users also share the page with their
friends: users D, and E. The Breeze plugin will recognize the need for the page
to be cached—as it is receiving frequent requests—and will go ahead to produce a
cache of that page. As a result, <strong>any subsequent user of that
  page</strong> (Ideally starting with user B in our example) <strong>will
  receive the cached version of the page, saving the web stack the processing
  that would be required for a data-retrieval trip to the database</strong>.
Ideally, you should set your page cache plugin to not only cache pages and
objects after the first request—but also pre-warm the cache in anticipation of
access.

<strong>Pre-warming the cache is essentially simulating user
  requests</strong>—triggering the creation of caches for those pages; in
anticipation of usage. For instance, in the eve of a huge sale on a WooCommerce
store, it is advisable to pre-warm the cache, and ensure that when the traffic
trickles in, users will experience enhanced page load speeds. Related: <a
  href="https://maniainc.com/technology/how-to-optimize-woocommerce-for-speed-and-security/"
>How to Optimize WooCommerce for Speed and Security</a>

With the right setup, page caching can be the easiest win—as it serves
pre-rendered HTML and keeps PHP and MySQL out of the loop—for most users.

<strong>Caching at the application level is nuanced, however, as your page cache
  plugin of choice needs the ability and capability to interface efficiently
  with your server</strong>—to ensure that caching works correctly. This way,
caching can also have a huge impact on turbo-boosting user response speeds.
Cloudways have thought this through, and introduced a custom page caching
plugin, Breeze. The purpose of this plugin is to ensure that caching happens
optimally for sites hosted on their platform.

How? The Breeze plugin is specifically built for their servers.

<strong>Breeze is powerful, to say the least, and includes a host of features,
  including page caching, database management, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript
  minification, and so much more</strong>. More importantly, it works optimally
with their plethora of cloud servers, and integrates with object caching
effectively. You can read more on <a

>how to set up the Breeze Caching Plugin</a>. Cloudways have gone a step further
and provide any and all servers on their platform with <strong>Redis Pro Object
  caching</strong>—entirely for free. Not only are you getting strong capable
servers, a set-and-forget page caching plugin, you also get to enjoy the
benefits of professional object caching with Redis Pro. [caption

definition, <strong>object caching is a server-side technique that stores
  frequent database objects</strong>—such as the results of frequent DB
queries—<strong>in memory; allowing faster results for subsequent
  queries</strong>.
<h3>2. The Server Layer of WordPress Caching</h3>
<strong>The server-layer of WordPress caching is more-or-less the gatekeeper,
  and sits in front of the web-server, serving full pages from memory</strong>.
It can be effected via Memcached or <a
  href="https://varnish-cache.org/intro/?utm_source=maniainc.com/tech"
>Varnish</a>—as is the case on Cloudways.
<blockquote>
  On Cloudways servers, Varnish is the gatekeeper; if it knows the page, it
  answers with cached HTML immediately—with PHP never running for that request.
</blockquote>
<figure>
  <img
    class="aligncenter"

  /><figcaption>

    content delivery. Source: Unsplash.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<strong>I cannot emphasize enough how powerful that is in terms of
  performance.</strong>

<strong>A normal uncached web request would be handled via PHP</strong>. The
request would be routed to the DB (let’s call it ‘PHP pre-processing’), a query
result returned, and then PHP undertakes ‘post-processing’, and routes the
result back to the user. This process can take anywhere from a few milliseconds
to as long as a minute—depending on the actual speed and power of your server.
With server-caching, however, and <strong>on a kitted-out host like Cloudways, a
  similar request wouldn’t require any PHP processing at all</strong>—requests
would be served instantly, from the Varnish cache. Beyond the obvious
performance benefits, Cloudways have also introduced Lightning Stack, which can
be coupled with premium CPU-Optimized or High-Performance cloud droplets. This
combination—<strong>CPU-Optimized/High-Performance servers + Lightning stack
  (Nginx + Apache + Varnish + PHP-FPM)</strong>—further turbo-boosts
performance. This is by ensuring that your site not only has the best
performance oriented tech, but also the capacity and capability to handle high
concurrent usage—and do it reliably. Think of a LearnDash LMS site where
thousands of students are taking a test at the same time.

<strong>Studies indicate that sites using lightning stack can experience faster
  page loading speeds by as much as 75%</strong>. Imagine that. You can read
more on how to Maximize ROI via this combination. The beauty of Cloudways,
moreover, is that <strong>you don’t have to worry about configuring Varnish, or
  tweaking page caching to accommodate it</strong>. All you have to do is
install the Breeze cache plugin, and the interface between page caching and
server-caching is completely taken care of for you. Do note that <strong>you can
  either use Varnish or Memcached as your server cache</strong>, and it is not
advisable (or even possible) to use both.
<h3>3. The Edge Caching Layer</h3>
<strong>Edge caching is caching done via edge servers, a feature of Content
  Delivery Networks, CDNs</strong>. One such CDN is Cloudflare, where copies of
your pages are stored in servers all over the world (edge servers).

<strong>Whenever a user requests a page or resource from your website, it is
  delivered from the edge server nearest to them</strong>. Needless to say, this
can elicit huge gains in page speeds; as the data would only have to travel far
less distance, as compared to all requests going to the origin server. Edge
caching makes your site load quickly from Singapore to San Francisco—it’s where
CDN meets global scale.

<strong>With Cloudways, you get to experience an Enterprise-level CDN at SMB
  costs—thanks to
</strong><a
  href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/cloudflare.php?utm_source=maniainc.com/technology/"
>the Cloudflare Enterprise Add-on</a><strong>, which is heavily
  discounted</strong> at less than $10. Mind you, the standard Cloudflare
Enterprise plan—when bought directly from the company—will set you back a few
thousand dollars every year… Imagine that.

<strong>Cloudflare Enterprise caches closer to visitors, and adds latency
  improvements</strong>. It also comes with hugely crucial features such as
Polish, Brotli, Argo Smart Routing, a Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Edge
Page Caching. We’ll discuss this in detail below.

  When set up correctly, edge caching adds another powerful layer of caching, on
  top of page caching—handled by the Breeze by Cloudways plugin.

<h2>
  3) WordPress Caching Application Layer Deep Dive — Breeze + Redis/Object Cache
  Pro
</h2>
Now that we understand what the several layers of WordPress caching are, we can
now delve deep into each layer—starting with the Application Layer. We’ll use
our setup on Cloudways as a point of reference, and share our experience
configuring and managing WordPress caching on their tech stack. On Cloudways,
the application layer of WP caching comprises <strong>the Breeze plugin and
  Redis Pro, our enterprise-grade object cache</strong>. Let’s look into each.

<strong>Breeze is a WordPress page cache plugin that also handles script
  minification, has browser cache controls, and an integration to purge the
  Varnish server cache—on Cloudways</strong>. Let me explain. [caption
id="attachment_6011" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img
  class="size-large wp-image-6011"
  src="https://maniainc.com/technology/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/Cloudways-Add-ons-and-Features-for-Improved-Web-Performance-Maximize-ROI-for-Your-SMB-Website-—-Cloudways-Lightning-Stack-CPU-Optimized-Servers-1024x737.jpeg"
  alt="Cloudways Add-ons and Features for Improved Web Performance - Maximize ROI for Your SMB Website — Cloudways Lightning Stack + CPU-Optimized Servers"
  width="1024"
  height="737"
/> Yes, with Cloudways you not only get really fast, highly-performant servers.
You also get a host of powerful add-ons and features to help you gain as much
competitive edge as possible. Source: Cloudways.[/caption] We earlier said that
<strong>the page cache handles caching at the WordPress/WooCommerce
  level—ensuring that pages are stored in temporary storage</strong> (cache), so
that these copies can be the one to be delivered for subsequent requests—without
the need for PHP processing and retrieval from the database. The Breeze plugin
by Cloudways is, however, much more than just a page cache. It has <strong>deep
  integration with Cloudways’ servers and is specifically built to be compatible
  with Varnish</strong>, the server-level cache we use.
<h3>Breeze Cache Plugin Features</h3>
The plugin also has additional features as follows.
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>DB manipulation features</strong> that allow you to clean up and
    optimize your WP/Woo database.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Support for Heartbeat API</strong>; which provides a communication
    protocol (that uses AJAX calls) between your WP site and the server.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Script minification and optimization features</strong>; that allow
    you to minify, inline or combine the CSS, HTML, or JavaScript on your
    site(s). Script minification is super important when it comes to page speed,
    and ensuring that your users won’t wait long for pages to load. Moreover, it
    also helps a lot with SEO, as search engines rank fast websites higher.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Controls for the browser cache</strong>. This is a big one, as you’d
    normally need to install a whole other plugin to be able to control how your
    pages are cached at the browser level for your users—i.e., on the browsers
    they use. This setup can also be quite complex, especially if you lack the
    technical know-how.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Native integration with Varnish on Cloudways.</strong> Since the
    Breeze plugin is custom-built for Cloudways’ servers—even though any site
    can use it—you get to enjoy ease when it comes to purging your server’s
    Varnish cache. Breeze allows you to purge Varnish right from your WP
    dashboard. Not only that, Breeze will also purge Varnish automatically
    whenever you make updates to your posts or pages.
  </li>
</ul>

  Troubleshooting WP Application Layer Caching Issues—with Cloudways CoPilot
</h3>
It is also important to mention that Cloudways also recently introduced
‘Cloudways CoPilot’, a hands-on intelligent troubleshooting assistant that’s
powered by #AI.

As such, for something like configuring controls for the browser cache, CoPilot
on Cloudways can come in very handy, to help you tweak the controls
specifically, for your custom setup. Beyond that, <strong>Cloudways CoPilot will
  always be on, monitoring the health of your server, and identifying any issues
  before they cause downtime</strong>. The magic of CoPilot is that it doesn’t
just tell you that something has gone awry. CoPilot not only shows you what’s
causing the issue, but also suggests how you can fix it—with code snippets. Even
better, it has a feature called <strong>CoPilot ‘SmartFix’</strong>, which is a
one-click solution to the particular issue you are experiencing. For instance,
maybe you are experiencing a disk-full issue.

<strong>CoPilot will recognize the issue, tell you why it is happening, what
  caused it, and recommend fixes; including a SmartFix</strong>—which could be
something like clearing old backups from your disk. <b><i>Try Cloudways CoPilot

<h4>Redis Pro Object Cache</h4>
<strong>Redis Object Cache Pro</strong> stores frequent database query results
(and PHP objects) in memory, ensuring they are delivered instantly from the
cache—and not refetched from the database each time they are requested. As a
result, <strong>DB requests get responses way faster, especially in sites with
  thousands-long catalogues</strong>—or WooCommerce stores with huge product
databases—that may otherwise weigh down the server.

<strong>Using the Redis Pro object cache, product fetches will be turbo
  boosted</strong>, ensuring that your customers can search for and purchase
products seamlessly. The Pro version of Redis Object Caching is an
enterprise-grade object caching tool and as we shared earlier, it is offered
completely free <a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=864773"
>on Cloudways for qualifying plans</a>. [caption id="attachment_5817"

will <a href="https://www.cloudways.com/blog/object-cache-pro-partnership/"
>save you at least $95 per month</a>, just by virtue of having your site hosted
on Cloudways. In my experience, object caching can be a powerful addition to
your tech stack, and it works even better when used alongside Elasticsearch.

<strong>Elasticsearch</strong>, or simply ES, is a distributed search engine
that indexes all the posts, products, templates, etc., on your site, and
facilitates speedy searches from the index—positing huge gains in database
search speeds. For instance, say you have a huge product DB on your Woo store. A
user may be looking for a product variant that isn’t readily available via the
shop pages, and with Elasticsearch, a search that may have taken tens of seconds
can be delivered almost instantaneously. With Cloudways, you also get
Elasticsearch via an add-on—completely free of charge—and you can couple it with
Redis Pro for enhanced database query speeds. [caption id="attachment_20210"

the many others that Cloudways offers—is that you don’t need to handle their
complex configurations yourself. Cloudways does that for you; and deals with the
complicated interfacing of something like ES with your server, and the
ElasticSearch WordPress plugin (ElasticPress).

<h3>
  How to Configure the Application Layer of WordPress Caching on Cloudways
</h3>
Here’s a practical config checklist for the application caching layer on
WP/WooCommerce:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Install the Breeze plugin</strong> and <strong>enable page cache +
      browser cache + script minification</strong> (as per your needs). Then
    head to Cloudflare and enable GZIP/Brotli compression. Ensure that you set
    static files to long expiry. More guidance on how to install and configure
    Breeze is available in <a
      href="https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/5126470-how-to-install-and-configure-breeze-wordpress-cache-plugin"
    >Cloudways’ Documentation</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Enable Redis</strong> in the Cloudways server dashboard and
    install/configure the Object Cache Pro plugin, as per <a
      href="https://www.cloudways.com/blog/object-cache-wordpress/"
    >Cloudways’ instructions</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Leave sessions and transients configured for Redis</strong> if you
    run an LMS LearnDash site or WooCommerce; but avoid caching dynamic
    pages—like cart and checkout—in full page caches. Sensitive cart/checkout
    fragments are already handled via Varnish/Edge Cache rules.
  </li>
</ul>
In simple terms, all you need to do is to turn on Breeze, flip Redis on—in the
Cloudways server panel, enable Object Cache Pro in WordPress—and you’ll have
taken care of the app caching layer for WP.
<blockquote>
  Breeze is the user-facing switch; Redis is the engine under the hood.

  4) Server Layer for WordPress Caching Deep Dive — Varnish + Lightning Stack +
  PHP-FPM
</h2>
<strong>The server layer for WordPress caching is where most of the magic
  happens.</strong> Caching at the server level can be done either via Varnish
or Memcached for WordPress/WooCommerce. On Cloudways, Varnish is used and can be
combined with the powerful Cloudways Lightning Stack and PHP-FPM—for maximum
cache efficiency, efficacy, and performance. At its core, <strong>Varnish is a
  high-speed HTTP reverse proxy that works by serving cached content from
  memory, accelerating delivery by factors</strong>. Varnish.org notes that it
can speed delivery by about 300x–1000x, depending on the architecture where it
is applied. You can watch the video below for <a
  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGD14ChpcL4"
>a high-level illustration of how Varnish works</a>.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGD14ChpcL4 On Cloudways’ web stack, Varnish
sits between the Edge Cache and Nginx. During a cache miss, the request is
routed as follows:

<strong><em>User request hits Cloudflare (edge) -&gt; Cloudways’ Varnish (port
    80) -&gt; (miss) -&gt; Nginx -&gt; Apache -&gt; PHP-FPM -&gt;
    MySQL</em></strong>. On a cache hit, however, Varnish returns the
‘on-memory’ copy of the page or resource—before PHP runs, and any additional
processing is done. [caption id="attachment_5782" align="aligncenter"

/> How Varnish server-side caching works. On Lightning Stack, Varnish can be
super-powerful in terms of reducing latency and increasing the efficiency of
handling dynamic requests. Source: Cloudflare.[/caption] Think of it this way:
<strong>Varnish is like an ATM. When you have a card</strong> (the server has a
cached version of the page or a cache hit in our case),<strong>
  then you can just withdraw and be away with your money</strong> (the resource
or page); without the need to enter the bank (PHP processing and ultimately,
your site’s database), and queue in line waiting to be served. But here’s the
thing, Cloudways offers Varnish on both standard servers, running the <a
  href="https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/11089267-how-to-change-your-application-stack"
>hybrid stack</a>, and now also on CPU-Optimized and High-Performance
servers—which are coupled with Lightning Stack for Ultra-Fast performance.

  Blazing-Fast Performance</a>
<h3>Why Varnish Matters:</h3>
It <strong>reduces DB and PHP usage drastically</strong>, and can be especially
impactful for documentation sites, high-traffic blogs, and static sections of
e-commerce stores. In terms of its interaction with LMS or WooCommerce sites,
<strong>it is important to always ensure cache bypass for cart, checkout, and
  account pages</strong>. Such pages are commonly referred to as <strong>dynamic
  pages</strong>. Cloudways are aware of the importance of these pages to your
business, and their <a
  href="https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/11516688-how-to-use-breeze-varnish-settings-to-improve-wordpress-performance"
>custom Varnish rules</a> serve to protect them. Even more, <strong>the Breeze
  plugin will automatically purge Varnish whenever content is updated</strong>.
This way, users won’t be served stale content and miss out on crucial (and
fresher) information such as product discounts, updated cart pages, or new LMS
test flows.
<h3>How Cloudways Lightning Stack Bolsters Varnish Caching</h3>
When your site grows and is at a level where it is experiencing high concurrent
usage, Cloudways’ Lightning Stack works to improve performance—by interfacing
with Varnish at the server level to boost caching efficiency. On Cloudways
Lightning Stack, the roles of its various components are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Nginx serves static files,</li>
  <li>Varnish caches pages (co-ordinating with breeze)</li>
  <li>Apache handles dynamic compatibility, and</li>
  <li>PHP-FPM executes PHP—very fast.</li>
</ul>
According to benchmarks, <strong>this set up can elicit page loading speed gains
  of up to 75%</strong>. Even more, both cached and uncached dynamic pages will
load faster, as lightning stack shifts from the slower (traditional) PHP
processing to Fast-CGI on PHP-FPM—which is much more performant. When thousands
of users are trying to purchase products on your Woo store (during a sale),
these millisecond performance tweaks could mean better profits, and the
maximization of your return on investment, ROI. [caption id="attachment_6019"

<h3>
  How to Configure the Server Cache Layer of WordPress Caching on Cloudways
</h3>
For the best results, ensure you follow these best-practices for your Varnish
config:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Keep Varnish enabled for public pages—while ensuring that checkout,
      cart, and login pages are excluded</strong>. If you use the Breeze plugin,
    this will be handled for you automatically.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>For static assets, use longer time-to-live, TTLs, and for HTML, use
      shorter TTLs</strong>. Using Breeze, also ensure that you configure cache
    purges to happen automatically on post updates. This can be especially
    helpful if you’re updating data feeds via an API—and/or when undertaking
    manual cache purges would be cumbersome (which is always in my opinion 😆).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Use tools such as </strong><a href="http://pagespeedtest.org"
    >pagespeedtest.org</a> <strong>to measure both cached and uncached response
      times</strong>. To ensure that users have a good experience, do not
    neglect uncached requests and always ensure response times for uncached
    requests (when cache misses occur) are optimal. For instance, your site may
    have a very robust forum, and if users cannot effectively see newer posts or
    comments—or when these pages take forever to respond, user experiences may
    be impacted negatively. Consequently, this could end up dissuading visits or
    even purchases—in the case of an e-commerce store.
  </li>
  <li>
    In terms of troubleshooting, <strong>if you see that stale content is being
      served on your site, ensure that Breeze is purging Varnish
      correctly</strong>. A misconfiguration of Varnish could lead to a lot of
    confusion for both you and your users—some may see fresher pages and others
    may miss out on the performance gains of Varnish. This is also true for
    instances where dynamic pages on your site are cached incorrectly—and if the
    issues persist, verify endpoint exclusions and also cookie rules in your
    Varnish rules. Note also that <strong>you can use the Cloudways server
      dashboard to purge Varnish</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>5) Edge Layer WordPress Caching Deep Dive — Cloudflare Enterprise</h2>
<strong>The best way to think of edge caching</strong>, when it comes to
WordPress caching layers, <strong>is as the icing on the cake of your caching
  setup</strong>. At the end of the day, your pages can be fast, but will still
have to travel all over the world to reach your global user base.

<strong>Edge caching is that last node</strong> (or the final messenger) <strong
>that ensures these pages and resources are delivered on time, and as fast as
  possible</strong> (both in terms of page speed, processing latency, and page
loading times). [caption id="attachment_4665" align="aligncenter"
width="1024"]<img
  class="size-large wp-image-4665"
  src="https://maniainc.com/technology/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/What-is-a-CDN_-How-to-Optimize-WooCommerce-for-Speed-and-Security-1024x512.png"
  alt="What is a CDN? How to Optimize WooCommerce for Speed and Security - Mania Developers"
  width="1024"
  height="512"
/> How the Cloudflare CDN works. A CDN delivers content via distributed servers.
Each user gets an instance of a page they have requested from the server closest
to them. Source: Cloudflare.[/caption] Thanks to the Cloudflare Enterprise
add-on by Cloudways, your WP or Woo Store can enjoy enhanced edge caching.
Cloudflare Enterprise provides the following enhancements:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>A global CDN that supports Edge page caching</strong>. Edge caching
    sits on top of the caching already happening at the application and server
    levels. Traffic flows like this: <strong><em>Cloudflare Edge Cache -&gt;
        Breeze Page Cache -&gt; Varnish Cache on the server -&gt; Object Caching
        -&gt; DB</em></strong>—a total of four caching layers, all working to
    ensure ultimate performance for your stack. Hypothetically, if each of these
    caching levels save processing times by at least 20%, then cumulatively,
    you’re looking at nearly 80% faster page loading times.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Argo Smart Routing</strong>; that enhances how traffic for your site
    is routed through Cloudflare. It works by optimizing the requests’ network
    path, which elicits gains in page speed, performance, and reliability. Argo
    smart routing scans through Cloudflare’s network, and finds the least
    congested and fastest route—for delivering your edge cache assets to your
    users. For instance, users in the global south (who are nearer to South
    Africa than Morocco), for instance, can have the site resources delivered to
    them via South Africa—instead of Morocco or the origin server, which may be
    situated in Europe or North America.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Brotli compression</strong>; that works on top of compression that
    Breeze already handles—to further lower resource sizes, ensuring faster
    delivery. In essence, Brotli compression on Cloudflare uses a modern
    lossless compression to reduce the file sizes of web assets—CSS, JS and
    HTML—improving performance and reducing bandwidth usage. What’s so crucial
    about bandwidth reduction—for instance—is that it ensures that no matter how
    big a product catalogue you have on your WooCommerce site, the page sizes,
    resource loads, and the cache files will not be too big also. There’s no
    point doing all these mods just to have an overblown cache—the point of
    caching is to reduce the processing and server resources it will take for
    web assets to be delivered to users/customers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Polish image optimization</strong>; that strips image metadata and
    applies both lossy and lossless compression to your site’s image files.
    Polish also ensures that image attributes—like image dimensions (height and
    width)—are applied correctly on each image. These attributes and their
    correct tagging is a common issue for numerous WP sites, especially when it
    comes to Large Contentful Paint, LCP. LCP is one of the metrics that Google
    uses to rate site speed and user experience. You can measure LCP using
    PageSpeed Insights on pagespeed.web.dev.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The HTTP/3 Protocol</strong>; which is the latest HTTP protocol. It
    utilizes the QUIC transport layer protocol—instead of the older TCP
    protocol. QUIC is more secure, much faster, and less vulnerable to issues
    like packet loss—and even the infamous ‘head-of-line’ blocking issues; that
    can slow down connections.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>Cloudflare Web Application Firewall, WAF</strong>. Perhaps the
    most crucial for site security, speed, and reliability, the Cloudflare WAF
    is the most useful of Cloudflare’s features for your site. In practice,
    Cloudflare acts as a proxy that sits between the open web and your site.
    This is hugely important as with the Cloudflare Firewall, any and all
    attacks can be caught and dealt with with, before reaching your site’s
    server. On Cloudflare Enterprise, moreover, the WAF is super-enhanced, and
    allows you to tweak ‘Managed Security Rules’. These are, essentially, ahe
    most impactful security blocks that Cloudflare applies <a
      href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=864773"
    >by default for all plans</a>; but on Enterprise, you can tweak them. For
    example, you can tweak managed rules to ensure that parts of your stack
    (that may have been unintentionally blocked by the firewall) are unblocked.
    Moreover, the WAF can also be enhanced by adding IP Lists—of sites to allow
    through the WAF, or to specifically block.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>In-depth analytics</strong>. Cloudflare also offers in-depth
    analytics for page traffic, HTTP access, and resource usage—or even site
    crawling. With Enterprise, you get custom analytics for everything—from who
    accesses your site, how often and from which IP. Not only that, but you also
    get protection for your site’s resources. This can be effected through the
    WAF, or by applying other filters and blocks. As such, not only is your site
    protected from attacks such as DDoS attacks, but you can also protect your
    site's resources from things like hotlinking, or even AI scraping.
    <strong>Hotlinking</strong> is where other sites use your site’s resources,
    taxing your server, and avoiding hosting the resources on their own
    servers—in a ploy to escape the server and bandwidth usage that would come
    with hosting those resources.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cloudways also offers <strong>the Cloudflare Enterprise add-on with edge
      caching controls and routing priority</strong>. Your edge cache, for
    example, can be purged from the Cloudways server dashboard. Moreover, to
    ensure you can effectively debug cache-hit ratios, Cloudways also offers
    Cloudflare analytics for ‘origin vs. cache request’ breakdowns. You can read
    more about Cloudflare Enterprise on Cloudways in their <a
      href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/cloudflare.php?utm_source=maniainc.com"

<h3>Other Useful Cloudways Features that Build on Caching</h3>
<h4>RabbitMQ Add-On—Free</h4>
<strong>RabbitMQ</strong> is <strong>a message queueing tool that queues
  tasks</strong>—such as sending emails, clearing caches, deleting transients,
etc. <strong>Queueing these tasks ensures that they are executed one after the
  other (sequentially) and do not weight down on your server or
  database</strong>—by trying to be executed all at once. Think of it this way,
<strong>instead of everybody trying to use the ATM at the same time, RabbitMQ
  acts as a guard on your server, that ensures everyone at the ATM queues—and
  only one person can access it at a time</strong>. Consequently, tasks are
handled much faster and server resources are not weighed down by their
execution. This can have a huge effect, especially when dealing with
high-traffic or high concurrent usage. [caption id="attachment_5827"
align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img
  class="size-large wp-image-5827"
  src="https://maniainc.com/technology/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/How-RabbitMQ-Works-Easy-and-Quick-WordPress-Optimizations-with-One-Click-and-One-Plugin-Solutions-Mania-Technology-1024x625.png"
  alt="How RabbitMQ Works - Easy and Quick WordPress Optimizations with One-Click and One-Plugin Solutions - Mania Technology"
  width="1024"
  height="625"
/> How RabbitMQ Works. RabbitMQ queues WordPress tasks for linear processing,
ensuring that these tasks do not overwhelm the database. Source: CAMQ.[/caption]
For instance, imagine thousands of learners taking a test (at the same time) on
a LearnDash LMS site.

<strong>Each answer must be recorded and put to storage in the DB</strong>—with
the correct tagging for the particular user (student), their details, and also
checked against the correct answers for grading. <strong>If these tasks were to
  be executed all at once (at the same time), then your site would likely
  crash</strong> as the database would be unable to handle all these
requests—and deliver accurate responses—in real-time.

<strong>RabbitMQ works to ensure that such a scenario does not occur and that
  there is efficiency during task execution</strong>—and it is fast… so fast.
You’d think that tens or even hundreds of tasks would be slowed down when
queued, but the opposite is actually true. The WordPress database can execute
fewer tasks much faster than it would be able to execute a huge number of tasks
altogether.

needs.

<em>PS: We may earn a commission at no extra cost to you :)</em>
<h4>NewRelic Integration—Free</h4>
The <strong>NewRelic integration on Cloudways</strong> is another hugely useful
feature on Cloudways. As a WordPress developer, creator, or even a site admin,
having insight into how your stack is performing, what’s working, what’s
failing, and how fast everything works can make such a huge difference.

<strong>NewRelic is an analytics tool</strong> that provides just that—you get
grain-like details about your stack, it’s modules, performance, response times,
and even better, you can set thresholds for alerts.

<img
  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5945"
  src="https://maniainc.com/technology/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Screenshot-2022-06-12-at-09-16-13-SCHPOTM-New-Relic-One-1024x534.png"
  alt=""
  width="1024"
  height="534"
/>For instance, <strong>you can configure NewRelic to alert you if Apache takes
  more than 500ms to respond</strong> to a request. NewRelic will alert you the
moment the threshold is reached, and then allow you to see (and sift through)
the numbers for your site’s Apache.

<strong>Such insight ensures that you’ll always stay on top of performance, and
  that you can effectively make decisions</strong>—to either tweak or upgrade
your setup—as you’ll have the data and information you need to make said
choices.
<h3>How to Configure the Edge Cache Layer of WordPress Caching on Cloudways</h3>
Edge caching acts as the global copy of your site—it reduces round trip time by
delivering a cached page from a nearby edge server. Consequently, a visitor in
Nairobi, for instance, doesn’t have to wait on a US origin for static parts of
your site. Here are a few best-practices for configuring the edge cache layer of
WordPress caching—Cloudflare Enterprise—on Cloudways.
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Only use ‘Cache Everything’ after you are confident that dynamic
      pages are excluded</strong>—otherwise combine the edge cache with origin
    cache control headers—or page rules—to ensure you exclude sensitive
    endpoints.
  </li>
  <li>
    For the best performance, <strong>combine Edge Page Caching with the Varnish
      server cache</strong>. With this config, Cloudflare can serve a cached
    page from the nearest edge server—and Varnish, on the other hand, can serve
    caches from the origin whenever a cache miss happens.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>For DNS and SSL configuration, use Cloudways’ one-click
      integration</strong>—as this approach will minimize manual certificate
    juggling or DNS flapping.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
  6) Unified Cloudways Caching Ecosystem — How the 3 Layers of Cloudflare
  Caching Interact
</h2>
By employing caching on the 3 different layers, you can leverage the power of
the Cloudways’ Caching Ecosystem. Here’s how traffic would flow:
<ol>
  <li>
    A request arrives at Cloudflare. With smart routing, Cloudflare serves
    cached copies of the requested resource—a cache hit.
  </li>
  <li>On a cache miss, however, the request goes through to Cloudways.</li>
  <li>
    Varnish checks its cache; and if a fresh copy exists, it serves the cached
    copy from server memory.
  </li>
  <li>
    If there’s a Varnish cache miss, the request is forwarded to Nginx/Apache
    -&gt; PHP-FPM -&gt; WordPress DB.
  </li>
  <li>
    Depending on the request, if Redis has a copy of the query’s response in
    memory, it is served.
  </li>
  <li>
    Alternatively, WordPress undertakes PHP processing and builds the response.
  </li>
  <li>
    The response is then stored in Redis (the returned DB objects) and Varnish
    (page cache).
  </li>
  <li>
    The request is then ferried back and could be potentially cached back to
    Cloudflare.
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>7) Real-World Results—How WordPress Caching is Improved on Cloudways</h2>
In the real-world, <strong>Varnish can accelerate content delivery dramatically,
  when configured correctly in a favorable architecture</strong>—<a
  href="https://varnish-cache.org/intro/"
>according to the Varnish project</a>. Moreover, <strong>the Cloudways Lightning
  Stack comes natively optimized for performance</strong>; meaning that at its
baseline, it will be very performant—with caching acting as an additional layer
of optimization. Even more, <strong>the Object Cache (Redis Pro) add-on is
  enterprise-grade software, offered entirely free of charge</strong>—an
opportunity for savings and utility that you shouldn’t miss. Cloudways does
partner with Redis, ensuring object caching on their server is well-configured
to bolster performance. To illustrate this, let’s take the case of a small blog,
Techly. Before a robust caching setup, Time to First Byte (TTFB) was 1.8 to
2.5s. With Cloudflare edge + Redis + Varnish, however, TTFB fell to 0.3 to 0.7s.
Similarly, a mid-size WooCommerce store, Umber, was able to reduce CPU load by
between 50 to 70% (under normal traffic) just by enabling Varnish + Redis. When
traffic peaked, CPU bursts were handled for longer, without the need for
autoscaling. [caption id="attachment_5781" align="aligncenter" width="1014"]<img

Getting started on Cloudways is super-simple, and you can follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>Use this link and <strong>create a Cloudways account</strong>.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Deploy a Cloudways server</strong>—choose a High-Performance or
    CPU-Optimized server if you expect heavy loads, especially for dynamic
    pages. This is the case for WooCommerce stores and LMS LearnDash sites. On
    the other hand, if you are a small to medium-sized blog with small to medium
    traffic, then Cloudways’ standard servers will also do.
  </li>
  <li>
    On the Cloudways server dashboard, head on to integrations tab and <strong
    >enable Varnish, Redis, RabbitMQ, and ElasticSearch</strong>. You can also
    enable the NewRelic integration, and set up a NewRelic account that you can
    link to your server.

    and log into it with the provided credentials.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Install the Breeze page cache plugin</strong> and enable page
    caching, GZIP compression, and the Varnish integration.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Enable Varnish</strong> on Cloudways and configure exclusions for
    dynamic pages such as cart and checkout pages—as well as admin pages. Note
    that Breeze will handle these configs for you, just by enabling the Varnish
    integration on the plugin—so you can skip this step if you are already using
    Breeze.
  </li>
  <li>
    Looking at the tabs on the server dashboard, one of the last tabs on the
    left is the Cloudflare Enterprise settings tab. Head there and <strong
    >enable Cloudflare Enterprise</strong>. Toggle on edge page caching, Brotli,
    Polish, and Argo smart routing. You will also see available analytics.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Validate the setup</strong>. Run cached and uncached tests on
    WebPageTest—and look out for first view and repeat view—and record cache-hit
    ratios, LCP, TTFB, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you face any issues during the setup, <strong>use Cloudways CoPilot to
      diagnose and apply fixes</strong>. A solution that works most often, esp
    for Varnish, is restarting the Varnish service, purging the cache, or
    running a disk cleanup—Cloudways provides functionality for that.
  </li>

<h2>9) Monitoring and Troubleshooting</h2>
Your site may be showing the following caching error symptoms and here’s how you
can fix them.

<strong>Symptom</strong>: Old content shows; after you have made updates.

<strong>Cause</strong>: Breeze’s Varnish cache purge was not propagated to the
server or to Cloudflare

<strong>Fix</strong>: If automatic purges by Breeze fail, you can try purging
the caches manually as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Purge Breeze</li>
  <li>Purge Varnish from the server dashboard</li>
  <li>Purge the Cloudflare Cache from the server dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Symptom</strong>: High CPU Usage under bursts.

<strong>Cause</strong>: Uncached endpoints due to cache misses or misconfigured
Varnish rules.

<strong>Fix</strong>: Check cache-hit ratios on the Cloudways server metrics
page, and in Cloudflare analytics. Alternatively, enable Varnish for more
sensitive endpoints, but be careful with regard to dynamic pages. Additionally,
you can try upgrading to a <a
  href="https://maniainc.com/technology/why-your-wordpress-multisite-is-slowing-down-and-how-cpu-optimized-hosting-can-fix-it/"
>CPU-Optimized or High-Performance instance</a>—these are specifically built for
increased concurrent usage.

<strong>Symptom</strong>: Redis not saving keys

<strong>Cause</strong>: Redis is hitting memory limits or is misconfigured.

<strong>Fix</strong>: Increase the memory allocation for Redis, or increase its
eviction policy limits. CoPilot can help you do this—as it can get technical—or
you can reach out to Cloudways’ 24/7 support team. Alternatively, you can refer
to Cloudways’ stellar documentation on object caching.

<h2>
  11) Conclusion: Why Leveraging Caching is Important for your WordPress Site
</h2>
<strong>Caching on WordPress is a layered strategy, and cannot just be ‘fixed’
  using a single plugin</strong>. Caching on WordPress needs to be integrated
very specifically with your server and the caching tools therein. It should also
be configured to work well with the edge cache.

<strong>The 3 caching layers can only bolster performance if they are structured
  and configured to work together—and in harmony with one another</strong>. This
calls for a web host that has thoroughly understood what it would take to
seamlessly integrate and coalesce these layers. Related: <a
  href="https://maniainc.com/technology/why-your-wordpress-multisite-is-slowing-down-and-how-cpu-optimized-hosting-can-fix-it/"
>Why Your WordPress Multisite Is Slowing Down — and How CPU-Optimized Hosting
  Can Fix It</a>

<strong>Cloudways is just that web host who has taken the time, invested the
  resources, and applied their experience</strong> to ensure they set up a
robust caching architecture. Caching starts at the application layer with their
powerful Breeze plugin. The plugin not only does page-caching, but also
interfaces with the servers’ Varnish cache. At the server layer, Varnish further
enhances caching by collaborating with Redis Pro object caching, which Cloudways
offers for free. Cloudways didn’t stop there—they also offer the Cloudflare
Enterprise Integration (at a heavily discounted price point); giving you
everything you need to leverage caching for improved performance, SEO, and user
experience. [caption id="attachment_6013" align="aligncenter" width="750"]<img

<strong>The few milliseconds caching can help you save—for each page load—can be
  the difference</strong> between a growing number of conversions on your
site—or last minute drop-offs; just when a customer is about to make a purchase.
The reason? Poor user experience, dysfunctional caching, slow load times, and
overall poor implementation of caching—at the various levels.

<strong>Cloudways’ servers come with a custom, pre-tested, and highly performant
  cache infrastructure</strong>. &nbsp; Hypothetically, you could mix all the
modules we’ve mentioned yourself—or using a developer. However, not only will it
take you ages, but you’ll also face insurmountable challenges as your host’s
servers may not be cache-ready. Cloudways’ servers are. They are <strong>built
  to natively support caching, have functionality for cache purges at all 3
  levels</strong>—and the team has the expertise and experience to help you
further customize the setup to your specific needs. Better yet, you can now use
Cloudways CoPilot to troubleshoot any issues you may have, without needing to
start support tickets or send emails. [caption id="" align="alignnone"

  Stop struggling to comb the internet for caching guides—the issue could be
  that your server is not built for caching.

Your server may be lacking the tools, setups, and infrastructure to support your
caching aspirations. The problem could be that simple. Don’t you think you
deserve better? I, for one, certainly think you do. Cheers. 🙂

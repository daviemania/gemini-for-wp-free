## External Tools

### Jules

- **Usefulness:**
  - **Improve Code Quality:** Run Jules to refactor and improve the readability of the existing theme or plugin code, making it easier to maintain.
  - **Enhance Test Coverage:** Use Jules to automatically generate unit tests for new or existing features, ensuring code changes are reliable and don't introduce bugs.
  - **Manage Dependencies:** Safely upgrade outdated dependencies within WordPress plugins or themes, which is crucial for both security and performance.

### Security Analysis

- **Usefulness:**
  - **Conduct Code Audits:** Perform comprehensive security scans on the entire codebase to identify and help remediate vulnerabilities like SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, or broken access control.
  - **Secure New Code:** Analyze any new PHP scripts, JavaScript, or other code written to ensure it is secure before deployment.

### Code Review

- **Usefulness:**
  - **Validate My Code:** Automatically review any code I write before submitting it, ensuring it's clean, efficient, and follows the project's conventions.
  - **Audit Existing Code:** Proactively review the existing codebase to identify areas for improvement, potential bugs, or style violations.
  - **Ensure Consistency:** Guarantee that my contributions align perfectly with the existing style and structure of the project.

### Critical Think

- **Usefulness:**
  - **Deconstruct Tasks:** Break down complex development requests into a clear, step-by-step implementation plan.
  - **Diagnose Issues:** Systematically analyze performance bottlenecks or bugs by evaluating potential causes and outlining a clear path to resolution.
  - **Evaluate Solutions:** When multiple implementation strategies exist, I can use it to weigh the pros and cons of each, helping us choose the best approach.
